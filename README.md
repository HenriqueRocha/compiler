This is a personal pet project that I'm working on to learn Rust.

It's a compiler based on the tutorials available here:
https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/

The original tutorials are written in Turbo Pascal and the code generation is done for the 
[Motorola 68000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000) processor.

I will adapt the code from Pascal to Rust while I'm learning this language and I will also adapt the code from the Motorola 68000 assembly
to GNU Assembler for x86.
